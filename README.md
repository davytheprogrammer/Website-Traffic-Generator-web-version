# TrafficGenerator
======
A powerful tool designed to generate authentic-looking traffic on a specific website or domain. Using customizable headless or visible browser instances, it creates user interactions that closely mimic real visitors, making it difficult to distinguish from genuine traffic. Perfect for testing website performance, improving SEO metrics, or simulating audience engagement.

## üåü Key Features

- **Authentic Browser Rendering**: Fully renders all content similar to a real browser experience
- **Intelligent Navigation**: Randomly selects and clicks links within the same domain
- **Customizable Settings**: Configure thread counts, click patterns, and timing parameters
- **Compatible with Google Analytics**: Properly triggers analytics tracking events
- **SEO Testing Compatible**: Helps evaluate how traffic impacts search ranking signals

## üìã Overview

This project generates website traffic using Selenium and Chrome WebDriver through a user-friendly Flask interface. Once initialized, the system automatically navigates through your website following natural browsing patterns while respecting domain boundaries.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**Windows Only**: This application is currently only compatible with Windows operating systems.

**Looking for an easier setup?** If you find this repository challenging to configure or need a traffic generator specifically designed for AdSense-level detection, check out our enhanced version:

üëâ [Website-Traffic-Generator-With-GUI](https://github.com/davytheprogrammer/Website-Traffic-Generator-With-GUI)

The GUI version offers a more streamlined setup process and advanced features for AdSense compatibility.

## üîß Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- Python 3.7+ installed
- Latest version of Chrome browser
- Chrome WebDriver that matches your Chrome version
- Basic understanding of command-line interfaces

## üöÄ Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/davytheprogrammer/Website-Traffic-Generator-web-version.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd Website-Traffic-Generator-web-version
   ```

3. **Create a Python virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install required dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. **Update the ChromeDriver path** in `main.py`:
   ```python
   CHROMEDRIVER_PATH = "C:/path/to/your/chromedriver.exe"
   ```

2. **Customize traffic parameters** in the `generate_traffic` function inside `app.py` if needed:
   ```python
   threads = 10          # Number of concurrent browser instances
   min_clicks = 2        # Minimum clicks per session
   timeout = 60          # Page load timeout in seconds
   max_offset = 10       # Maximum delay between actions
   ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Program

1. **Start the Flask application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

3. **Enter your website** and desired settings in the web interface

4. **Monitor** the ongoing traffic generation through console output

## üîç How It Works

The system launches multiple Chrome instances (visible or headless based on configuration) that:

1. Visit your specified website domain
2. Wait a randomized period to simulate reading content
3. Find all links on the page that lead to the same domain
4. Randomly select and click a link to navigate further
5. Repeat the process for the configured number of clicks

This creates a natural browsing pattern that activates all standard tracking mechanisms like Google Analytics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Chrome version mismatch**: Ensure your ChromeDriver version matches your Chrome browser version
- **Path issues**: Use absolute paths for ChromeDriver location
- **Performance concerns**: Reduce thread count if system performance degrades
