TrafficGenerator
======
This tool can be used to generate real (fake) traffic on a specific website (domain). It uses the headless browser phantomjs, so that all content will be rendered similar to a real browser, making it hardly to distinguish. Can be used to generate traffic for google adsense too

After visiting a page the tool will randomly select one link from the page and click on it. Only links from the same domain are visited.

## Usage 
ALL I AM REQUESTING IS FOR YOU TO STAR THE REPO
The usage should be quite simple. 


```
```run the app.py
download the latest chromedriver that is the same as the chrome version you are using
